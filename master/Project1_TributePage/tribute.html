    <p>
      This webpage was developed to talk about my Computer Science Education.
      Most developers are fortunate enough to learn in a course with an instructor but not all of us are so
      lucky.  The other purpose of this page to share resources for other aspiring programmers to learn from.
      I do not claim to be an expert at any of these languages.
      I'm actually quite new myself.
      It is my hopes that young computer scientists can use this webpage to attain more information in
      any of the following languages.

    <h1 class="text-center">Java</h1>
    <p>
      Java was the first language that I learned.
      I studied this language when I was a student at Western Carolina University.
      It was a very good introductory language and it inspired me to continue learning other languages.
      Java is commonly used in many appliances and stand-alone electronics.
      Perhaps it is most known for its use in Android products.
      Java features include: Object Orientation, Garbage Collection, and Built-in String Types.

    <h1 class="text-center">C</h1>
    <p>
      The next programming language I attempted to learn was C.
      My professors at WCU recommended I continue studying Computer Science through edx and I found
      great courses on C there.
      C as a programming language is becoming a bit out of date but is still highly powerful.
      Though it lacks built -in features, it allows users to touch memory specifically in their system.
      Because of this, it is used almost exclusively to build Operating Systems.

    <h1 class="text-center">Python</h1>
    <p>
      Python is another course I learned through online MOOCs.
      I started learning it in CS50 but then took a course more focused on the language through MIT's 6.00x.
      Python is a very high-level language, meaning it handles most of the mundanity on its own.
      It removes tedious aspects such as memory management and curly braces to allow the user to focus more on
      data management and problem solving.

    <p>
      The final languages to discuss are one big family that work together.
      HTML, CSS, and Javascript (and jQuery) are one group of languages that allow you create your own webpages.
      By working with the relationship between these languages you can make very interesting and beautiful
      webpages.  Some people consider web development a weak form of programming but I find it to be
      very good for beginning programmers to learn the idea of syntax and it can be done
      without a strong machine.  To learn more about web development, visit
